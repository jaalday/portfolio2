        <p className="text">Pet MD is a comprehensive website designed specifically for pet owners, allowing them to easily fill out forms and access crucial medical information with just a few taps. As a Veterinary Technician, I've often encountered pet owners who are unsure about the medications their pets are taking. This app provides a convenient solution, ensuring that vital information is always readily available.</p>
        <br/>
        <p className="text">Owners can add as many pets as they want to their profile. Each pet has a separate card with their information on it, and an associated history card.
