     <br/>
      <p> I am a full stack developer with a passion for creating. If my projects haven't given it away, I absolutely love cats and enjoy sneaking them into my code. I have three cats of my own, and when i'm not coding, you can usually find me relaxing with them or painting. </p>
      <p>Before diving into the world of coding I spent time as a Veterinary Assistant. I have always had a love for animal welfare and still volunteer when I can. </p>
      <p>In my free time I enjoy hiking, painting and gardening.  </p>
      <br/>
      <p> I am currently looking for a full time position as a developer. If you would like to know more about me, please feel free to reach out! </p>
